# Ames Housing Sales Price Analysis Project

This project explores the attributes that influence the sales price in Ames city, Iowa, and attempts to model and predict the housing sales price on a given set of attributes.

## Problem Statement

Some professionals have been posted to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service's National Animal Disease Center (NADC).\
These folks (some have families, while some are singles) are interested to know what housing features or attributes they should be looking out for, and what are the trade-offs in costs they should weigh and consider as they go about house-hunting.\
Many housing agents are excited about the sudden influx of business and commissions. You are no different and would like to set yourself apart from the crowd of agents to secure these potential clients.

## Outside Research

Ames is a relatively small city with an area of approximately 72km<sup>2</sup>. Ames is best known as the home of Iowa State University (ISU). In fact, ISU lies at the heart of the city surrounded by all residential neighbourhoods in Ames. The city of Ames has a historic tradition of supporting strong neighborhoods which forms the foundation of a vibrant community.\
For an house hunter, one can be assured of a supportive community regardless of the neighborhood that one chooses to stay in.\
For someone who have daily commutes to the NADC which is situated adjacent to Interstate 35, expect private commute time to be well within 20 minutes even if one stay at the opposite far end of Ames city, in the neighbourhood of CollgCr (College Creek).\
Ames has a humid continental climate with 4 seasons. Summer averages around 30â„ƒ while winter can get to sub-zeros.\

## Executive Summary

An influx of home seekers are making housing agents excited in a relatively calm housing market in Ames with its small population. To capitalize on this opportunity, I have developed a relative quick and simple regression model through supervised machine learning.

Because I have utilized a natural logarithm function on the housing sales price, some transformation is carried out to interpret the coefficients of the modelled equation.

To that end, the interpreted equation coefficients and variables are on a multiplicative scale relative to each other, i.e. y = exp(ax1) * exp(bx2) * ... * k-constant instead of the conventional y = ax1 + bx2 + ... + k-constant that speaks to an absolute and independent interpretation of each variable and its coefficient.

Notwithstanding that, this model fulfills the main criteria on translating and understanding the impact of housing attributes to its sales price, with a R-sq score of 0.86.

While this model meets the minimum viable product (MVP) requirement, it remains a continuous work in progress to update and tune it as the housing data we have used to train the model are all backdated to least 6 years ago.

## Conclusions

Through the deployment of a supervised machine learning regression model, i.e. providing known dataset to the machine to run an ordinary least squares regression, I am able to derive an optimum model after tuning for the hyperparameters on L1 and L2 penalties through Lasso and Ridge respectively. A simpler linear regression was also conducted to compare the respective models performance.

Given the results, my choice of model would be between ridge and linear regression. Both have very similar R-sq, RMSE, even the coefficients, and they are really not that different. Lasso is not selected as the lasso model has been scaled, therefore its coefficients needs to be rescaled before we can make meaningful interpretation. Thus, since there are no significant advantages in adopting the lasso model, I have narrowed my selection to between ridge and linear regression.

| model             | test R-sq | test RMSE |
|:------------------|:---------:|:---------:|
|lasso	            |  0.87552  |  0.14266  |
|ridge	            |  0.87558  |  0.14262  |
|linear regression  |  0.87557  |  0.14262  |

Since the linear regression model and ridge are similar, I have chosen the linear regression model for simplicity. (recurring theme :)\
Because the y-variable is log sale price, the model coefficient needs to be transformed into an exp(coefficient) which I have already done so below.\
Given all things equal, for every unit increase in any of the below feature, there will be a corresponding multiplicative impact on the sale price as shown in the table.\
E.g. If say, a house in a particular neighbourhood is currently valued at 200k\$.\
If we compare it to an identical and adjadent house with similar attributes save for its the overall quality being higher by 1 rating, say from 6 to 7 (in a scale of one to ten).\
In this case, the model predicts that the sale price of the house will be higher by a magnitude of 1.0563x, to 211k\$.\
We can also use this model to compare houses with different attributes to understand their expected difference in sale price.

## Recommendations

As home seekers, you might be particularly interested in certain neighbourhoods to buy a house at, or if you are keen to know how the sale price of the house vary with their attributes and properties. If you have a specific query regarding these, I could certainly help with providing you details on the expected price differences.

For example, some attributes that you may be considering could be the size of the house, the kitchen quality, the garage quality, the age of the house, etc.\
As an illustration, if you are considering between 2 similar adjacent houses in the same neighbourhood. And these houses are quite similar except that one has an excellent quality fireplace while another does not have a fireplace. Then you are looking at a 9% price difference between them.

Lets say the one without a fireplace costs \$200k, the one with the excellent fireplace will then cost you \$18k more at \$218k.\
If you have a very specific house that you are looking at, given their attributes, I could also provide you with an expected sale price of the house.

Knowing the expected damage to your pocket could help you assess if you are willing to pay for a better quality feature or if the extra costs are not worthwhile.

So wait no longer, sign up as me for a comprehensive housing consulting service and makes your house hunting endeavour seamless and stress-free.
